        // The genders of celestial bodies that do not have articles (that is,
        // all but « le Soleil », « la Terre », and « la Lune ») are somewhat
        // unclear.  From the gender of their namesakes, it appears to drift
        // towards that of their category, with the planets in particular
        // becoming feminine, e.g., in the 1955 edition of Astronomie Populaire,
        // « Mars est-elle habitée ? ».
        // The situation is messier still for moons (do they bear the gender of
        // their namesake, that of moon, that of satellite?) and minor planets
        // (the options are the namesake, dwarf planet, or asteroid).
        // We use the genders of the namesakes systematically, which is
        // consistent with Littré for those that had been discovered at the
        // time, and is easier than trying to find the most commonly attested
        // gender at the time of writing.

        // The bodies with articles should really be Soleil^m, Terre^f, and
        // Lune^f, with the articles added by the caller using <<A:1>> if
        // needed, so that phrases such as « système Terre-Lune » can be
        // expressed.  Unfortunately the stock strings were written without
        // the requisite As, so they require the articles.  Mods that wish to do
        // more advanced grammar will need to strip them and lowercase the
        // gender.
